 Installation Documentation for "Introduction To TSO/E REXX"

 The RXINTRO member of this PDS is in TSO XMIT format. You must
 receive the file, download it to your workstation/PC in binary
 format, and un-zip it.

 1) TSO RECEIVE INDA('cbt.file434(RXINTRO)')
      - you will be prompted to enter a data set name:
    DA('userid.REXX.INTRO.ZIP')

 2) Transfer the file you received/created in step 1 to your
    workstation/PC. Make sure the transfer is binary (do not use
    ASCII/CRLF if using IND$FILE, use the "BIN" option if using
    FTP). Name the file something like "REXXINTRO.ZIP" on the PC
    side.

 3) You should now have a usable ZIP file you can UNZIP. The
    unzipped file is called REXXINTRO.DOC. The file was created
    using Microsoft Word.
