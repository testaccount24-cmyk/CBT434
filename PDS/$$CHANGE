          ***************************




 CBT509   ?????? 20xx
01/11/2025 - Updated the COLADD edit macro to ignore commas if DECimal
             data is being added.


 CBT508   December 2024
11/01/2024 - Added the TWOPAK25 job. This is the same as the TWOPAK24
             job and can be used to create a "rescue" system from a
             z/OS 2.4 or z/OS 2.5 system.  The difference is that
             this version uses DFDSS (ADRDSSU) instead of FDRCOPY as
             FDR is no longer available to me. Also adding in /
             copying of FDR into the rescue system is also removed.
             and this version now requires a single 3390-9 volume
             regadless of the name "TWOPAK*". A larger geometry
             volume can be used of course and may even be needed
             depending on local files used and any desired changes
             to the JES2 spool size, SMF, page datasets etc.
11/01/2024 - Added the CRPL edit macro.  This edit macro can be used
             to create or replace a member in the current PDS that
             is being EDITed or VIEWed and then EDIT that member.
11/01/2024 - Added the VIEWREP edit macro.  Using the macro / issuing
             the "VIEWREP" command from an ISPF view session will
             replace the contents of the PDS member or flat file
             currently being viewed in ISPF.


 CBT507   August 2024
02/20/2024 - Updated doc references in RXINTRO (Introduction To REXX
             word document) and wording in the $RXINTRO instructions
             that explain how to extract it.


 CBT506   December 2023
05/01/2023 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Add JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 2.5.
             2) Add IPA updates for z/OS 2.5: CRYPCTRS.


 CBT505   April 2023
03/24/2023 - Updated RXSTOR64 to expand the following fields
             from 7 to 9 bytes (from 6 to 7 digit numbers):
             "ALLOC MEM", "GUARDED MEM", "HWM MEM" & "SHARE HWM".


 CBT503   July 2022
12/27/2021 - Updated ONEPAK22 with a note that it could be used
             with z/OS 2.4 and removed IOEDFSXP from AUTHPGM
             in IKJTSO00 parmlib member (SYS1.SIOALMOD wasn't in
             the sample to start with). Also removed references
             to NETVTM.SCNMLPA1 (NETVIEW) since that library
             is not required. Also made some JES2PARM changes
             but they aren't related to z/OS 2.2 though z/OS 2.4.
12/27/2021 - Updated comments in TWOPAK22 to indicate that the
             zFS root will not fit on a single 3390-3 volume and
             using 3390-9 is recommended.  Also updated comments
             about required customization for TCPIP access.
             Added HMCS and SYSCONS to the sample CONSOL00
             member that is built.
12/27/2021 - Updated comments in TWOPAK23 to indicate that the
             zFS root will not fit on a single 3390-3 volume and
             using 3390-9 is recommended.  Also updated comments
             about required customization for TCPIP access.
             Added HMCS and SYSCONS to the sample CONSOL00
             member that is built.  Also made some JES2PARM
             changes but they aren't related to z/OS 2.3.
12/27/2021 - Added the TWOPAK24 job. This is an update to the
             TWOPAK23 job and can be used to create a "rescue"
             system from a z/OS 2.4 driving system.


 CBT500   Dec 2020
09/30/2020 - Changed the DSLISTSV CLIST to make STATS creation
             a parm instead of hard coded to NO (which is the
             default still).
09/24/2020 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Add JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 2.4.
             2) Add IPA updates for z/OS 2.4: RUCSA and BOOST.
             3) Changed the max symbol length in the Symbol display
                from 10 (8 max + ampersand and period) to 18 for
                z/OS 2.2 and above (16 max + ampersand and period).


 CBT499   May 2020
05/06/2020 - Added the SDSFPRT program. This program uses the SDSF
             REXX environment to take all or selected output from
             the spool and copy it to a PDS via SDSF "PRINT"
             commands.


 CBT498   December 2019
08/28/2019 - Updated the SDSF@DR REXX to change the "ST" panel
             invocation from:
             Address SDSF "ISFEXEC ST (DELAYED ALTERNATE)"
               to
             Address SDSF "ISFEXEC ST (DELAYED)"
             in case no alternate panel is defined.  By
             default both primary and alternate fields are
             merged if an alternate exists anyway.
07/01/2019 - Added the DSLISTSV and MEMLSTSV CLIST and REXX EXEC.
06/17/2019 - For z/OS 2.3 and above, added IPA updates for SMFTBUFF,
             OSPROTECT, ICSF and ICSFPROC.
             SMFTBUFF was added via APAR OA52828.
             OSPROTECT was added via APAR OA54807.
             ICSF / ICSFPROC was added via APAR OA55378.
06/17/2019 - Updated the "GET_CPCSI" code in IPLINFO for a larger
             offset into IRALCCT to get the CPC SI info for all
             z/OS 2.3 systems.  The previous change only did it for
             a z14, but the fix is also needed for z13. The problem
             is that I don't know what APAR / PTF makes the larger
             offset required nor if it is processor specific.


 CBT497   April 2019
04/24/2019 - Added the TWOPAK23 job. This is an update to the
             TWOPAK22 job and can be used to create a "rescue"
             system from a z/OS 2.3 driving system.
04/24/2019   Updated the comments in the TWOPAK22 job. Changes
             from TWOPAK21 were accidentally left out of the
             comments section.  I also removed the comments
             that stated the job could be also be used for
             for z/OS 2.3 since there is now a separate sample
             job for z/OS 2.3.
03/06/2019 - Updated the "GET_CPCSI" code in IPLINFO for a larger
             offset into IRALCCT to get the CPC SI info for z/OS 2.3
             at RSU1812 and above running on a z14 (the offset is an
             additional 8 bytes).  I don't know what PTF(s) broke it
             or if there is a similar change for OS versions lower
             than z/OS 2.3.
01/03/2019 - Added a "REVerse" mode to CMD34 to process the data
             set list in reverse order.  "REVerse" mode is useful
             when you are trying to delete GDGs plus the GDG
             base(s) in the data set list, otherwise the command
             will fail against the GDG base since there are still
             GDGs that exist in the base.


 CBT496   November 2018
10/12/2018 - Added the ONEPAK22/TWOPAK22 jobs. These are updates to
             the ONEPAK21/TWOPAK21 jobs and can be used to create a
             "rescue" system from a z/OS 2.2 driving system. They
             should work for z/OS 2.3 also with no changes.

10/12/2018 - Updated the SDSF@DR REXX to check for
             "*BOTTOM OF DATA REACHED*" so it is not displayed as
             an error message from XDC. I'm not sure when IBM added
             this as the code was written in 2009. It may have been
             in z/OS 2.1.


 CBT495   January 2018
12/01/2017 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Add IPA updates for z/OS 2.3: RACF, FXE & IZU.
             2) Add JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 2.3.
             3) Fix catalog information display in IPL section when
                LOADxx SYSCAT definition is blank / using defaults
                for SYS% to SYS1 conversion (col. 16) and/or alias
                name level (col. 17).
             4) Change RACF version information to match the z/OS
                version instead of the FMID for z/OS 2.2 and above.
                RCVTVRMN always has 7791 starting with z/OS 2.2
                which is not correct.
             5) Add "AUX" undocumented alias for the "PAGE" option.
04/29/2017 - Added RXSMF30 program.  This is a REXX sample to read
             SMF 30 records to produce a job accounting report.


 CBT492   August 2016
10/11/2016 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Add IPA updates for z/OS 2.2: SMFLIM & IEFOPZ.
             2) Add JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 2.2.
             3) Add some additional SMS information from the SMS
                SSI Vector Table.
             4) Add "EDIt" option that can be specified as the
                3rd parm to edit the output, similar to the
                Nobrowse option. Also changed the check in the
                XLATE_NONDISP subroutine from "> '00'x" to ">=
                '00'x" after seeing a subsystem with x'00' as
                part of the name in the edited output (and the
                ISPF warning about invalid / non-display
                characters).
             5) Add 2G page information to LFAREA display in the
                VMAP section.
             6) Fixed a rounding problem in the "FORMAT_MEMSIZE"
                subroutine for sizes over 1024G that should be
                displayed using "M" instead. The problem was seen
                in the HVSHARE display in the VMAP section.
08/27/2016 - Add 2G page information to LFAREA display in RXSTOR64
             and also added a "NODETAIL" option so only system
             wide totals are displayed for HVSHARE/HVCOMMON/LFAREA.
08/27/2016 - Fixed a rounding problem in the "FORMAT_MEMSIZE"
             subroutine for sizes over 1024G that should be
             displayed using "M" instead in the following EXECs:
             IPLINFO, RXSTOR64, REXXSTOR
08/21/2016 - Added a "Showdups" option to the DELDUPS edit macro
             which will show the duplicate lines instead of deleting
             them.


 CBT491   July 2016
05/15/2016 - Add code to LOGRREXX to remove LS_ALLOCAHEAD(0) if
             system is not z/OS 2.2. The parm is added to lower
             level systems after OA44680 for z/OS 2.2 toleration.
04/04/2016 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Reverted change from 3/12/2015 that changed the
                method of finding the real storage online at IPL for
                z/OS 2.1 and above. IBM opened APAR OA48094 to fix
                the original problem.
             2) Add an undocumented option alias: SSN for SUBsystems.
04/04/2016 - Updated the assembler ASIDLIST and JOBCHECK programs
             to support the ASVT in 31-bit storage which is available
             via DIAGxx CBLOC in z/OS 2.1 and above.


 CBT490   November  2015
05/21/2015 - Change IPLINFO LFAREA display in z/OS 2.1 and above
             to include PAGEABLE1M allocations.  Before the change
             these are incorrectly reported as 4K allocations on
             z/OS 2.1.
05/21/2015 - Change RXSTOR64 LFAREA total display in z/OS 2.1 and
             above to include PAGEABLE1M allocations.  Before the
             change these are incorrectly reported as 4K allocations
             on z/OS 2.1.
05/20/2015 - Fix truncation of "PARESZSL" in the IPLINFO page data
             set display to support the number of slots possibly
             defined on a 3390-54.
05/14/2015 - Add offset change into IRALCCT for CPC SI info as a
             comment in IPLINFO for z/OS 1.13 with z13 maintenance
             applied.
03/12/2015 - IPLINFO updates:
             1) Change method of finding online storage at IPL time
                for z/OS 2.1 and above as CVTRLSTG was not always
                correct. A field from the RIT is used instead.
             2) Add code to show SCM (Storage Class Memory) usage
                to the "PAGE" section similar to "D ASM,SCM"
                output for z/OS 2.1 and above.
01/29/2015 - Updated the REXXMEM memory display utility to work with
             64-bit addresses.  Using 64-bit addresses requires
             z/OS 2.1 or above.


 CBT489   November 2014
10/27/2014 - Added the ONEPAK21/TWOPAK21 jobs. These are updates to
             the ONEPAKZD/TWOPAKZD jobs and can be used to create a
             "rescue" system from a z/OS 2.1 driving system.


 CBT488   June 2014
05/07/2014 - IPLINFO updates for z/OS 2.1:
             1) Updated GET_CPCSI code for larger offset into
                IRALCCT to get the CPC SI info for z/OS 2.1.
             2) Added JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 2.1.
             3) IPA additions for z/OS 2.1 - 5 IEASYSxx PARMs:
                  PAGESCM, WARNUND, HZS, GTZ and HZSPROC.
05/07/2014 - Updated the REXXMEM help panel.
05/07/2014 - Updated the SMPDELF sample job for deleting
             an SMP/E function.
05/07/2014 - Updated $SNGLTSO doc related to JES3 for z/OS 2.1.
05/01/2014 - Added LFAREA system totals into the VMAP section
             of IPLINFO similar to the "D VS,LFAREA" operator
             display output.
11/22/2013 - Added code to IPLINFO to split the "Supported Subsystem
             Function Codes" display for a given subsystem across
             multiple lines if needed to avoid truncation.
11/13/2013 - Updated REXXMEM to support indirect storage addressing
             similar to IPCS.
11/01/2013 - XEF:  Changed the check in XEFCLIST for a null data set
             name in the data set list to be after the code to
             process the "FIND" option. Version is now 6.4.3


 CBT487   October 2013
10/07/2013 - Added "Help" to the following edit macros:
             COLADD, COLUTIL, DELDUPS, DELNX, DELX, EXCL, FILL,
             INCL, INSLINE, PREFIX, PREFIX2, SUFFIX.
             Also added a check into "FILL" to make sure the fill
             data would fit within the columns specified.
10/07/2013 - Updated the "FIND_LABELS" routine in the following
             edit macros to a better / simpler version:
             COLADD, COLUTIL, FILL, INSLINE, PREFIX, PREFIX2, SUFFIX
10/01/2013 - Updated the DELDUPS edit macro to allow labels to be
             used to limit the range of the operation.
08/23/2013 - Added code to IPLINFO to display the ACF2 data set
             names currently in use plus removed equal sign from
             "CLPA=" and "CVIO=" in the IPA display.  These parms
             have no value when specified in IEASYSxx.  Also
             changed the code that checks for CLPA used at IPL
             time to look at a specific BIT in ASMFLAG2.


 CBT486   April 2013
01/17/2013 - XEF Changes - version is now 6.4.2:
             1) Blank out the saved "F" in the option field if any
                data sets are found that match the search string.
             2) Change XEFMENU panel so the command field is now
                the "Other DSN" field instead of the option field
                so options that conflict with scrolling remain
                in the option field while scrolling the list of
                data sets (M, D, & P). Also added code to the panel
                to allow the full option name to be used instead of
                a single character.  For example: "EDIT" instead of
                "E", "BROWSE" instead of "B" etc.
01/17/2013 - Added additional comments in the source code of IPLHIST
             that describe how to use it.


 CBT485   December 2012

10/22/2012 - Changed the method IPLINFO uses to get the RACF primary
             data set name and also display the backup data set and
             multiple (split) data sets if they exist.


 CBT484   July 2012

07/05/2012 - Added the ONEPAKZD/TWOPAKZD jobs. These are updates to
             the ONEPAKZ8/TWOPAKZ8 jobs and can be used to create a
             "rescue" system from a z/OS 1.12 or z/OS 1.13 driving
             system. ONEPAKZ8/TWOPAKZ8 were also updated with some
             changes to the comments.
06/18/2012 - XEF Changes - version is now 6.4.1:
             1) Force "DSLIST" option when a data set
                is chosen from the menu that contains a pattern.
             2) Added delete member confirmation for the XEF member
                list and also honor the CONFIRM setting.
06/18/2012 - Added delete member confirmation for XMEMLIST and also
             honor the CONFIRM setting.
06/18/2012 - Added new "LINETBL" table sample for supporting ISPF
             line macros natively in z/OS 1.13 (ISPF 6.3) and above.
04/10/2012 - Updated the ISPF Considerations section of the $SNGLTSO
             doc member related to ISPF profile sharing and z/OSMF.
03/19/2012 - IPLINFO Updates:
             1) Added JES2 node offset and JES3 FMIDs for z/OS 1.12
                and z/OS 1.13.
             2) Added new parms to the IPA display: AUTOR for
                z/OS 1.12 and above and CATALOG / IXGCNF for
                z/OS 1.13 and above.
             3) Remove RTLS from the IPA display for z/OS 1.13
                and above.
02/13/2012 - Changed description of SVCESRMX in IPLINFO SVC display
             of ESRs from "Max Entries" to "Max ESR Num Supported".
01/03/2012 - Added an "SVC" option / display to IPLINFO and made the
             help panel scrollable. Also added the IPL TOD (GMT) from
             from the IPA to the IPA section.


 CBT483   December 2011

08/19/2011 - Added LSQA usage to REXXSTOR and changed the way
             "Region Available" is calculated.  The new method is
             a better estimation and considers LSQA usage.
08/04/2011 - Fixed 2 errors in IPLINFO identified by the REXX
