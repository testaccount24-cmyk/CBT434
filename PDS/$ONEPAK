 Creating ONEPAK / TWOPAK Systems Using DFSMSdss Instead of FDRCOPY
 ------------------------------------------------------------------

 I often get emails from people about my ONEPAK and TWOPAK jobs
 stating that they don't have FDR and asking if I have a version that
 uses DFSMSdss or some other method.  The answer, is "NO" as I do not
 want to maintain multiple versions and virtually 100% of all the
 shops I've ever worked at or consulted for had FDR available.

 However, DFSMSdss can easily be used (although adding the SSA prefix
 to the data set names is not as easy to do as it is with FDR).  Below
 is an example of what needs to be done to modify my ONEPAK and TWOPAK
 jobs to use DFSMSdss instead of FDRCOPY.  Obviously this is just a
 sample of a few data sets and all of the required data sets need to
 be added to the "INCLUDE" list and "RENAMEUNCONDITIONAL" list.


 //COPY   EXEC  PGM=ADRDSSU,REGION=4M
 //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
 //OUT      DD  VOL=SER=SYS1PK,UNIT=SYSALLDA,DISP=OLD
 //SYSIN    DD  *
  COPY DATASET   -
           (INCLUDE(      -

      SYS1.ISF.SISFLINK   -
      SYS1.ISF.SISFLOAD   -
           ))             -
